<strong><u>Lab Session 03 </u></strong><strong><u>Exercise:</u></strong>

<strong><u>Question 1:</u></strong>

Obtain the state space representation for the system shown below. Solve the resulting state equations using MATLAB <em>ode45</em> function (write complete script). Plot the position <em>x</em><em><sub>a</sub>(t)</em> and velocity <em>v</em><em><sub>a</sub>(t)</em> for Mass M<sub>1 </sub>and position <em>x</em><em><sub>b</sub>(t)</em> and velocity <em>v</em><em><sub>b</sub>(t)</em> for Mass M<sub>2 </sub>of the system with respect to time for <em>t = 0 </em>to <em>400</em> sec considering the following cases and write in your words about what you observed by looking at different plots. (Attach plot under each case).

[<em>Use separate A4 sheets for plots and attach it with this document</em>]

<u>Case 1: </u>M<sub>2</sub> = M<sub>1</sub> = 750

B<sub>1</sub> = B<sub>2</sub> = 20

K<sub>1</sub> = K<sub>2</sub> = 15 B<sub>3</sub> = 30 f = 300

<u>Case 2:</u>

Change the value of M<sub>1</sub> from 50 to 650 with a step size of 200 and record your observation. Attach  all the plots while changing values of M<sub>1</sub>. Keep other parameters to be same as in <em>Case 1</em>.

<u>Case 3:</u>

Change the value of M<sub>2</sub> from 50 to 650 with a step size of 200 and record your observation. Attach  all the plots while changing values of M<sub>2</sub>. Keep other parameters to be same as in <em>Case 1</em>.

<u>Case 4:</u>

Change the value of B<sub>1</sub> from 5 to 20 with a step size of 5 and record your observation. Attach  all the plots while changing values of B<sub>1</sub>. Keep other parameters to be same as in <em>Case 1</em>.

<u>Case 5:</u>

Change the value of B<sub>2</sub> from 5 to 20 with a step size of 5 and record your observation. Attach  all the plots while changing values of B<sub>2</sub>. Keep other parameters to be same as in <em>Case 1</em>.

<u>Case 6:</u>

Change the value of B<sub>3</sub> from 10 to 30 with a step size of 10 and record your observation. Attach  all the plots while changing values of B<sub>3</sub>. Keep other parameters to be same as in <em>Case 1</em>.
